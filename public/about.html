<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate and detail-oriented web developer with a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies.
  From crafting responsive user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to building dynamic web applications using 
  frameworks like React and backend tools such as Flask or Node.js,I enjoy bringing ideas to life on the web. My goal 
  is to create seamless digital experiences that are not only visually appealing but also functional and user-centric.</p>

<p>Throughout my development journey, I have worked on a variety of projects, including personal websites, college ERP systems, 
  and productivity tools. These experiences have sharpened my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of real-world 
  application development. I am also well-versed in using version control tools like Git, implementing REST APIs, and working with 
  databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB.</p>

<p>I am always eager to learn and stay updated with the latest industry trends. Whether it's experimenting with new design systems, 
  optimizing performance, or diving into DevOps practices, Iâ€™m driven by a constant curiosity to grow as a developer. I thrive in 
  collaborative environments and take pride in writing clean, maintainable code that contributes meaningfully to projects. My portfolio 
  reflects not just my technical skills, but my dedication to building intuitive and efficient web solutions.</p>
